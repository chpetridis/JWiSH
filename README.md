# JWiSH
JWiSH is a project for  [Slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_slicing) automated 
generated GUIS. It introduces a new kind of slice (widget slice)
as well as provide an elegant architecture for the tool
with great potential for evolution.


These slices can later be used by third party developers to automate some refactoring techniques like 
* Separate Event-Handling from Widget Initialization
* Make widget Initialization methods (e.g. createButton())
* Extract Class for a finer GUI structure
* ...
